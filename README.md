## Circle Text Generator

Built off Flask, HTML, SASS, and JavaScript.

Flask will be critical to make this operational.

Then I can host it publically.

What I'm thinking is user can pick between several things:

- can choose the image
- Can choose how many rings it will have.
- Can choose the text that will encirle it.
- Change the colors the text is.
- Change how many they are.
- Change the speed of the animation ( animation duration)
- Change the rotation direction, thats pretty easy. Just change the degree values in the keyframe.
